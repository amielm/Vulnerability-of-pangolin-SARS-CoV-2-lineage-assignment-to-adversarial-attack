# Vulnerability-of-pangolin-SARS-CoV-2-lineage-assignment-to-adversarial-attack
The code for the experiments used for carrying out an adversarial attack and assessing it's performance on pangolin SARS-CoV-2 lineage assignment.

All the notebooks used for our attack and analysis are present.
Note:
- Some stages of the attack were run directly in the command line such as running pangolin on the original and adversarial sequences.
- The paths in the notebooks have been censored for privacy reasons
- Some parts of the code may require a lot of RAM or runtime
